# Thousand Island Scanner (THIS): Scaling Video Analysis on AWS Lambda

Video analysis is computationally and monetarily expensive. 
We present a scalable video analysis framework based on 
[Scanner](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner) that uses 
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) 
to efficiently meet usersâ€™ computational needs while minimizing
unused resources by quickly scaling up and down.

This branch is for GPU tests.
