# File Name: histogram.py
# Author: Qian Li
# Created Date: 2017-10-20
# Description: This file is the basic sample end-to-end
# pipeline that ingests a video into Scanner, compute
# the histogram, and then extract the result.
# And it will also save the trace file
# Modified from Scanner/examples/tutorial/*
